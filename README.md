# About Me
My name is Kaleb Mattison. I am a dedicated worker that loves to learn new things and take on new challenges. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp to help me broaden my skills and knowledge. I have a big focus on family and enjoy spending time with them hiking, biking and camping but also appreciate a night in watching movies or playing video games with my sons
